# 1. [deposit tracking software](https://github.com/akhilarun23/JAVA-simple-projects-daily/commit/4d0fb96fbf2c3d3c64daa1cc3ef90f88dfbac0fc):
  The BankAccount class has a constructor that takes account number and balance as arguments. It also has methods to deposit and withdraw money, and to check the account balance.

  The SavingsAccount class is a subclass of BankAccount and overrides the withdraw() method. It checks if the account balance falls below one hundred before allowing a withdrawal. The method prints an error message if the balance is below one hundred. If the balance is greater than or equal to one hundred, the method calls the withdraw() method of the superclass to withdraw.

  In Main() method -

  The main method begins by creating an instance of the BankAccount class with an account number of "BA1234" and an initial balance of $500. It then deposits $1000 into the account and displays the new balance. It then withdraws $600 from the account and displays the new balance.

  Next, the method creates an instance of the SavingsAccount class with an account number of "SA1234" and an initial balance of $450. It then attempts to withdraw $300 from the account and displays the new balance. Since the balance remains above the minimum $150 balance required for the account, the withdrawal is successful.


  Finally, the method creates another instance of the SavingsAccount class with an account number of "SA1000" and an initial balance of $300. It then attempts to withdraw $250 from the account, which would bring the balance below the minimum balance required for the account. The method displays the new balance after the attempted withdrawal, which should still be $300 since the withdrawal was unsuccessful.

# 2.[MADLIBS](https://github.com/akhilarun23/JAVA-simple-projects-daily/blob/main/MadLibs.java)
# Java Mad Libs

## Description
Mad Libs is a fun word game where players fill in the blanks of a short story with different types of words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.), leading to hilarious or unexpected results. In this project, we'll use Java to create an interactive Mad Libs game.

## Features
- Prompts users to enter words for blank spaces in a story
- Generates a funny or unexpected story using user input
- Runs in the console
- Demonstrates the use of Java variables and user input

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Scanner class for user input

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mad-libs-java.git
   cd mad-libs-java
   ```
2. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac MadLibs.java
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java MadLibs
   ```

## Example Output
```
Enter a noun: dog
Enter a verb: runs
Enter an adjective: happy
Enter an adverb: quickly

Here is your Mad Libs story:
The happy dog runs quickly through the park!

# 3.[PLANTING A TREE IN JAVA](https://github.com/akhilarun23/JAVA-simple-projects-daily/blob/main/plantingATree.java)

# üå≤ Tree Planting Program in Java

## üìå Description
This is a simple Java program that prints a tree pattern to the console. It demonstrates the use of `System.out.println()`, loops, and basic formatting techniques to display a visually appealing tree structure. Additionally, the program introduces a short animation effect using `Thread.sleep()`.

## üöÄ Features
- Prints a tree pattern in the console.
- Uses a method to structure the code better.
- Implements a delay effect for a simple animation.
- Beginner-friendly Java program.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Java

# 4.[Math Magic](https://github.com/akhilarun23/JAVA-simple-projects-daily/blob/main/MathMagic.java)
# üßÆ Magic Number Calculation

This Java program demonstrates arithmetic operations using integer variables.

## üìå Overview
The program initializes a number, performs a series of mathematical operations, and prints the final result.

## üñ•Ô∏è Code
```java
public class Magic {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int myNumber = 3;  // Initialize the original number
        int m = 0;         // Initialize a variable to store results

        // Applying a series of arithmetic operations
        m *= myNumber;  // m = 0 * 3 = 0
        m += myNumber;  // m = 0 + 3 = 3
        m /= myNumber;  // m = 3 / 3 = 1
        m += 17;        // m = 1 + 17 = 18
        m -= myNumber;  // m = 18 - 3 = 15
        m /= 6;         // m = 15 / 6 = 2 (integer division)

        System.out.println(m);  // Output: 2
    }
}
üìñ Explanation
Step-by-step Execution
int myNumber = 3;

This initializes myNumber with the value 3.
int m = 0;

The variable m is set to 0.
m *= myNumber;

m = 0 * 3 = 0 (Multiplying by zero keeps m as 0.)
m += myNumber;

m = 0 + 3 = 3 (Adding myNumber to m.)
m /= myNumber;

m = 3 / 3 = 1 (Integer division results in 1.)
m += 17;

m = 1 + 17 = 18 (Adding 17 to m.)
m -= myNumber;

m = 18 - 3 = 15 (Subtracting myNumber.)
m /= 6;

m = 15 / 6 = 2 (Integer division discards decimals.)
System.out.println(m);

Prints 2 as the final output.
üöÄ How to Run
Install Java JDK if not already installed.

Save the code in a file named Magic.java.

Open a terminal and navigate to the file location.

Compile and run the program using:

sh
Copy
Edit
javac Magic.java
java Magic
üéØ Expected Output
Copy
Edit
2
üõ†Ô∏è Modifications
You can change myNumber to test different cases.
Modify the operations to observe different results.
